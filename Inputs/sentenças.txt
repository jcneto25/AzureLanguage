Staff were friendly and helpful. Miriam checked us in with care and kindness - especially as we arrived late and were super tired after 20hours travelling! The room was clean and with good facilities, although a little worn but still good value for the money.

The room was clean, good size. Location was perfect, super close to the Mia International Mall and Dolphin Mall. Short ride to MIA Airport as well.
Breakfast was good, good variety and quality.
Walls are not very thick. We could hear everything from the room next door.

Rooms were nice and clean. The location is also central, very close to two malls and a bestbuy.
Breakfast could have had more options
